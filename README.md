# Dynamo-Browse

A CLI tool for browsing DynamoDB tables.

![dynamo-browse](https://dynamobrowse.app/images/dynamo-browse/main-item-view.png)

This was built to make it easy to quickly view and lightly edit
DynamoDB tables, running locally or within AWS, from the Terminal
without having to learn incantations with the CLI or
go to the AWS console itself.  This helps from unnecessary context switching
if you tend to use the terminal a lot.
